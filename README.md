# Vina Usage

You should clone the AutoDock-Vina [repo]() and use its example to learn how to use the tool.

## Software Requirements

Note, its [official docs installation guide](https://autodock-vina.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) is out-to-date. I have provides two scripts under `./src` that provides installation steps to get these stacks.

- `Python==3.9.7`
- `conda==23.5.0`
- `AutoDock Vina v1.2.3`
